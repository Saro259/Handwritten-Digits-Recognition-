# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition
Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in machine learning and computer vision. It involves recognizing handwritten digits (0-9) from images or scanned documents. This task is widely used as a benchmark for evaluating machine learning models especially neural networks due to its simplicity and real-world applications such as postal code recognition and bank check processing. In this article we will implement Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Network.
